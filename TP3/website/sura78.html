      <h4>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </h4>
      <ul>
         
         
         
         
         <li>Of what do they ask one another?</li>
         
         <li>About the great event,</li>
         
         <li>About which they differ?</li>
         
         <li>Nay! they shall soon come to know;</li>
         
         <li>Nay! Nay! they shall soon know.</li>
         
         <li>Have We not made the earth an even expanse?</li>
         
         <li>And the mountains as projections (thereon)?</li>
         
         <li>And We created you in pairs,</li>
         
         <li>And We made your sleep to be rest (to you),</li>
         
         <li>And We made the night to be a covering,</li>
         
         <li>And We made the day for seeking livelihood.</li>
         
         <li>And We made above you seven strong ones,</li>
         
         <li>And We made a shining lamp,</li>
         
         <li>And We send down from the clouds water pouring forth abundantly,</li>
         
         <li>That We may bring forth thereby corn and herbs,</li>
         
         <li>And gardens dense and luxuriant.</li>
         
         <li>Surely the day of decision is (a day) appointed:</li>
         
         <li>The day on which the trumpet shall be blown so you shall come forth in hosts,</li>
         
         <li>And the heaven shall be opened so that it shall be all openings,</li>
         
         <li>And the mountains shall be moved off so that they shall remain a mere semblance.</li>
         
         <li>Surely hell lies in wait,</li>
         
         <li>A place of resort for the inordinate,</li>
         
         <li>Living therein for ages.</li>
         
         <li>They shall not taste therein cool nor drink</li>
         
         <li>But boiling and intensely cold water,</li>
         
         <li>Requital corresponding.</li>
         
         <li>Surely they feared not the account,</li>
         
         <li>And called Our communications a lie, giving the lie (to the truth).</li>
         
         <li>And We have recorded everything in a book,</li>
         
         <li>So taste! for We will not add to you aught but chastisement.</li>
         
         <li>Surely for those who guard (against evil) is achievement,</li>
         
         <li>Gardens and vineyards,</li>
         
         <li>And those showing freshness of youth, equals in age,</li>
         
         <li>And a pure cup.</li>
         
         <li>They shall not hear therein any vain words nor lying.</li>
         
         <li>A reward from your Lord, a gift according to a reckoning:</li>
         
         <li>The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, the Beneficent God,
            they shall not be able to address Him.
         </li>
         
         <li>The day on which the spirit and the angels shall stand in ranks; they shall not speak
            except he whom the Beneficent God permits and who speaks the right thing.
         </li>
         
         <li>That is the sure day, so whoever desires may take refuge with his Lord.</li>
         
         <li>Surely We have warned you of a chastisement near at hand: the day when man shall see
            what his two hands have sent before, and the unbeliever shall say: O! would that I
            were dust!
         </li>
         
      </ul>
