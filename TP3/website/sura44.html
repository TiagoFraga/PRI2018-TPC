      <h4>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </h4>
      <ul>
         
         
         
         
         <li>Ha Mim!</li>
         
         <li>I swear by the Book that makes manifest (the truth).</li>
         
         <li>Surely We revealed it on a blessed night surely We are ever warning — </li>
         
         <li>Therein every wise affair is made distinct,</li>
         
         <li>A command from Us; surely We are the senders (of apostles),</li>
         
         <li>A mercy from your Lord, surely He is the Hearing, the Knowing,</li>
         
         <li>The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, if you would be
            sure.
         </li>
         
         <li>There is no god but He; He gives life and causes death, your Lord and the Lord of
            your fathers of yore.
         </li>
         
         <li>Nay, they are in doubt, they sport.</li>
         
         <li>Therefore keep waiting for the day when the heaven shall bring an evident smoke,</li>
         
         <li>That shall overtake men; this is a painful punishment.</li>
         
         <li>Our Lord! remove from us the punishment; surely we are believers.</li>
         
         <li>How shall they be reminded, and there came to them an Apostle making clear (the
            truth),
         </li>
         
         <li>Yet they turned their backs on him and said: One taught (by others), a madman.</li>
         
         <li>Surely We will remove the punishment a little, (but) you will surely return (to
            evil).
         </li>
         
         <li>On the day when We will seize (them) with the most violent seizing; surely We will
            inflict retribution.
         </li>
         
         <li>And certainly We tried before them the people of Firon, and there came to them a
            noble apostle,
         </li>
         
         <li>Saying: Deliver to me the servants of Allah, surely I am a faithful apostle to
            you,
         </li>
         
         <li>And that do not exalt yourselves against Allah, surely I will bring to you a clear
            authority:
         </li>
         
         <li>And surely I take refuge with my Lord and your Lord that you should stone me to
            death:
         </li>
         
         <li>And if you do not believe in me, then leave me alone.</li>
         
         <li>Then he called upon his Lord: These are a guilty people.</li>
         
         <li>So go forth with My servants by night; surely you will be pursued:</li>
         
         <li>And leave the sea intervening; surely they are a host that shall be drowned.</li>
         
         <li>How many of the gardens and fountains have they left!</li>
         
         <li>And cornfields and noble places!</li>
         
         <li>And goodly things wherein they rejoiced;</li>
         
         <li>Thus (it was), and We gave them as a heritage to another people.</li>
         
         <li>So the heaven and the earth did not weep for them, nor were they respited.</li>
         
         <li>And certainly We delivered the children of Israel from the abasing chastisement,</li>
         
         <li>From Firon; surely he was haughty, (and) one of the extravagant.</li>
         
         <li>And certainly We chose them, having knowledge, above the nations.</li>
         
         <li>And We gave them of the communications wherein was clear blessing.</li>
         
         <li>Most surely these do say:</li>
         
         <li>There is naught but our first death and we shall not be raised again.</li>
         
         <li>So bring our fathers (back), if you are truthful.</li>
         
         <li>Are they better or the people of Tubba and those before them? We destroyed them, for
            surely they were guilty.
         </li>
         
         <li>And We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them in
            sport.
         </li>
         
         <li>We did not create them both but with the truth, but most of them do not know.</li>
         
         <li>Surely the day of separation is their appointed term, of all of them;</li>
         
         <li>The day on which a friend shall not avail (his) friend aught, nor shall they be
            helped,
         </li>
         
         <li>Save those on whom Allah shall have mercy; surely He is the Mighty the Merciful.</li>
         
         <li>Surely the tree of the Zaqqum,</li>
         
         <li>Is the food of the sinful,</li>
         
         <li>Like dregs of oil; it shall boil in (their) bellies,</li>
         
         <li>Like the boiling of hot water.</li>
         
         <li>Seize him, then drag him down into the middle of the hell;</li>
         
         <li>Then pour above his head of the torment of the boiling water:</li>
         
         <li>Taste; you forsooth are the mighty, the honorable:</li>
         
         <li>Surely this is what you disputed about.</li>
         
         <li>Surely those who guard (against evil) are in a secure place,</li>
         
         <li>In gardens and springs;</li>
         
         <li>They shall wear of fine and thick silk, (sitting) face to face;</li>
         
         <li>Thus (shall it be), and We will wed them with Houris pure, beautiful ones.</li>
         
         <li>They shall call therein for every fruit in security;</li>
         
         <li>They shall not taste therein death except the first death, and He will save them from
            the punishment of the hell,
         </li>
         
         <li>A grace from your Lord; this is the great achievement.</li>
         
         <li>So have We made it easy in your tongue that they may be mindful.</li>
         
         <li>Therefore wait; surely they are waiting.</li>
