      <h4>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </h4>
      <ul>
         
         
         
         
         <li>I swear by the angels who violently pull out the souls of the wicked,</li>
         
         <li>And by those who gently draw out the souls of the blessed,</li>
         
         <li>And by those who float in space,</li>
         
         <li>Then those who are foremost going ahead,</li>
         
         <li>Then those who regulate the affair.</li>
         
         <li>The day on which the quaking one shall quake,</li>
         
         <li>What must happen afterwards shall follow it.</li>
         
         <li>Hearts on that day shall palpitate,</li>
         
         <li>Their eyes cast down.</li>
         
         <li>They say: Shall we indeed be restored to (our) first state?</li>
         
         <li>What! when we are rotten bones?</li>
         
         <li>They said: That then would be a return occasioning loss.</li>
         
         <li>But it shall be only a single cry,</li>
         
         <li>When lo! they shall be wakeful.</li>
         
         <li>Has not there come to you the story of Musa?</li>
         
         <li>When his Lord called upon him in the holy valley, twice,</li>
         
         <li>Go to Firon, surely he has become inordinate.</li>
         
         <li>Then say: Have you (a desire) to purify yourself:</li>
         
         <li>And I will guide you to your Lord so that you should fear.</li>
         
         <li>So he showed him the mighty sign.</li>
         
         <li>But he rejected (the truth) and disobeyed.</li>
         
         <li>Then he went back hastily.</li>
         
         <li>Then he gathered (men) and called out.</li>
         
         <li>Then he said: I am your lord, the most high.</li>
         
         <li>So Allah seized him with the punishment of the hereafter and the former life.</li>
         
         <li>Most surely there is in this a lesson to him who fears.</li>
         
         <li>Are you the harder to create or the heaven? He made it.</li>
         
         <li>He raised high its height, then put it into a right good state.</li>
         
         <li>And He made dark its night and brought out its light.</li>
         
         <li>And the earth, He expanded it after that.</li>
         
         <li>He brought forth from it its water and its pasturage.</li>
         
         <li>And the mountains, He made them firm,</li>
         
         <li>A provision for you and for your cattle.</li>
         
         <li>But when the great predominating calamity comes;</li>
         
         <li>The day on which man shall recollect what he strove after,</li>
         
         <li>And the hell shall be made manifest to him who sees</li>
         
         <li>Then as for him who is inordinate,</li>
         
         <li>And prefers the life of this world,</li>
         
         <li>Then surely the hell, that is the abode.</li>
         
         <li>And as for him who fears to stand in the presence of his Lord and forbids the soul
            from low desires,
         </li>
         
         <li>Then surely the garden — that is the abode.</li>
         
         <li>They ask you about the hour, when it will come.</li>
         
         <li>About what! You are one to remind of it.</li>
         
         <li>To your Lord is the goal of it.</li>
         
         <li>You are only a warner to him who would fear it.</li>
         
         <li>On the day that they see it, it will be as though they had not tarried but the latter
            part of a day or the early part of it.
         </li>
