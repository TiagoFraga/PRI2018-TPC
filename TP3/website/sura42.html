      <h4>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </h4>
      <ul>
         
         
         
         
         <li>Ha Mim.</li>
         
         <li>Ain Sin Qaf.</li>
         
         <li>Thus does Allah, the Mighty, the Wise, reveal to you, and (thus He revealed) to those
            before you.
         </li>
         
         <li>His is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, and He is the High, the
            Great.
         </li>
         
         <li>The heavens may almost rend asunder from above them and the angels sing the praise
            of
            their Lord and ask forgiveness for those on earth; now surely Allah is the
            Forgiving, the Merciful.
         </li>
         
         <li>And (as for) those who take guardians besides Him, Allah watches over them, and you
            have not charge over them.
         </li>
         
         <li>And thus have We revealed to you an Arabic Quran, that you may warn the mother city
            and those around it, and that you may give warning of the day of gathering together
            wherein is no doubt; a party shall be in the garden and (another) party in the
            burning fire.
         </li>
         
         <li>And if Allah had pleased He would surely have made them a single community, but He
            makes whom He pleases enter into His mercy, and the unjust it is that shall have no
            guardian or helper.
         </li>
         
         <li>Or have they taken guardians besides Him? But Allah is the Guardian, and He gives
            life to the dead, and He has power over all things.
         </li>
         
         <li>And in whatever thing you disagree, the judgment thereof is (in) Allah's (hand); that
            is Allah, my Lord, on Him do I rely and to Him do I turn time after time.
         </li>
         
         <li>The Originator of the heavens and the earth; He made mates for you from among
            yourselves, and mates of the cattle too, multiplying you thereby; nothing like a
            likeness of Him; and He is the Hearing, the Seeing.
         </li>
         
         <li>His are the treasures of the heavens and the earth; He makes ample and straitens the
            means of subsistence for whom He pleases; surely He is Cognizant of all things.
         </li>
         
         <li>He has made plain to you of the religion what He enjoined upon Nuh and that which
            We
            have revealed to you and that which We enjoined upon Ibrahim and Musa and Isa that
            keep to obedience and be not divided therein; hard to the unbelievers is that which
            you call them to; Allah chooses for Himself whom He pleases, and guides to Himself
            him who turns (to Him), frequently.
         </li>
         
         <li>And they did not become divided until after knowledge had come to them out of envy
            among themselves; and had not a word gone forth from your Lord till an appointed
            term, certainly judgment would have been given between them; and those who were made
            to inherit the Book after them are most surely in disquieting doubt concerning
            it.
         </li>
         
         <li>To this then go on inviting, and go on steadfastly on the right way as you are
            commanded, and do not follow their low desires, and say: I believe in what Allah has
            revealed of the Book, and I am commanded to do justice between you: Allah is our
            Lord and your Lord; we shall have our deeds and you shall have your deeds; no plea
            need there be (now) between us and you: Allah will gather us together, and to Him
            is
            the return.
         </li>
         
         <li>And (as for) those who dispute about Allah after that obedience has been rendered
            to
            Him, their plea is null with their Lord, and upon them is wrath, and for them is
            severe punishment.
         </li>
         
         <li>Allah it is Who revealed the Book with truth, and the balance, and what shall make
            you know that haply the hour be nigh?
         </li>
         
         <li>Those who do not believe in it would hasten it on, and those who believe are in fear
            from it, and they know that it is the truth. Now most surely those who dispute
            obstinately concerning the hour are in a great error.
         </li>
         
         <li>Allah is Benignant to His servants; He gives sustenance to whom He pleases, and He
            is
            the Strong, the Mighty.
         </li>
         
         <li>Whoever desires the gain of the hereafter, We will give him more of that again; and
            whoever desires — the gain of this world, We give him of it, and in the
            hereafter he has no portion.
         </li>
         
         <li>Or have they associates who have prescribed for them any religion that Allah does
            not
            sanction? And were it not for the word of judgment, decision would have certainly
            been given between them; and surely the unjust shall have a painful punishment.
         </li>
         
         <li>You will see the unjust fearing on account of what they have earned, and it must
            befall them; and those who believe and do good shall be in the meadows of the
            gardens; they shall have what they please with their Lord: that is the great
            grace.
         </li>
         
         <li>That is of which Allah gives the good news to His servants, (to) those who believe
            and do good deeds. Say: I do not ask of you any reward for it but love for my near
            relatives; and whoever earns good, We give him more of good therein; surely Allah
            is
            Forgiving, Grateful.
         </li>
         
         <li>Or do they say: He has forged a lie against Allah? But if Allah pleased, He would
            seal your heart; and Allah will blot out the falsehood and confirm the truth with
            His words; surely He is Cognizant of what is in the breasts.
         </li>
         
         <li>And He it is Who accepts repentance from His servants and pardons the evil deeds and
            He knows what you do;
         </li>
         
         <li>And He answers those who believe and do good deeds, and gives them more out of His
            grace; and (as for) the unbelievers, they shall have a severe punishment.
         </li>
         
         <li>And if Allah should amplify the provision for His servants they would certainly
            revolt in the earth; but He sends it down according to a measure as He pleases;
            surely He is Aware of, Seeing, His servants.
         </li>
         
         <li>And He it is Who sends down the rain after they have despaired, and He unfolds His
            mercy; and He is the Guardian, the Praised One.
         </li>
         
         <li>And one of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and what He has
            spread forth in both of them of living beings; and when He pleases He is
            all-powerful to gather them together.
         </li>
         
         <li>And whatever affliction befalls you, it is on account of what your hands have
            wrought, and (yet) He pardons most (of your faults).
         </li>
         
         <li>And you cannot escape in the earth, and you shall not have a guardian or a helper
            besides Allah.
         </li>
         
         <li>And among His signs are the ships in the sea like mountains.</li>
         
         <li>If He pleases, He causes the wind to become still so that they lie motionless on its
            back; most surely there are signs in this for every patient, grateful one,
         </li>
         
         <li>Or He may make them founder for what they have earned, and (even then) pardon
            most;
         </li>
         
         <li>And (that) those who dispute about Our communications may know; there is no place
            of
            refuge for them.
         </li>
         
         <li>So whatever thing you are given, that is only a provision of this world's life, and
            what is with Allah is better and more lasting for those who believe and rely on
            their Lord.
         </li>
         
         <li>And those who. shun the great sins and indecencies, and whenever they are angry they
            forgive.
         </li>
         
         <li>And those who respond to their Lord and keep up prayer, and their rule is to take
            counsel among themselves, and who spend out of what We have given them.
         </li>
         
         <li>And those who, when great wrong afflicts them, defend themselves.</li>
         
         <li>And the recompense of evil is punishment like it, but whoever forgives and amends,
            he
            shall have his reward from Allah; surely He does not love the unjust.
         </li>
         
         <li>And whoever defends himself after his being oppressed, these it is against whom there
            is no way (to blame).
         </li>
         
         <li>The way (to blame) is only against those who oppress men and revolt in the earth
            unjustly; these shall have a painful punishment.
         </li>
         
         <li>And whoever is patient and forgiving, these most surely are actions due to
            courage.
         </li>
         
         <li>And whomsoever Allah makes err, he has no guardian after Him; and you shall see the
            unjust, when they see the punishment, saying: Is there any way to return?
         </li>
         
         <li>And you shall see them brought before it humbling themselves because of the
            abasements, looking with a faint glance. And those who believe shall say: Surely the
            losers are they who have lost themselves and their followers on the resurrection
            day. Now surely the iniquitous shall remain in lasting chastisement.
         </li>
         
         <li>And they shall have no friends to help them besides Allah; and — whomsoever
            Allah makes err, he shall have no way.
         </li>
         
         <li>Hearken to your Lord before there comes the day from Allah for which there shall be
            no averting; you shall have no refuge on that day, nor shall it be yours to make a
            denial.
         </li>
         
         <li>But if they turn aside, We have not sent you as a watcher over them; on you is only
            to deliver (the message); and surely when We make man taste mercy from Us, he
            rejoices thereat; and if an evil afflicts them on account of what their hands have
            already done, then-surely man is ungrateful.
         </li>
         
         <li>Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He creates what He pleases; He
            grants to whom He pleases daughters and grants to whom He pleases sons.
         </li>
         
         <li>Or He makes them of both sorts, male and female; and He makes whom He pleases barren;
            surely He is the Knowing, the Powerful.
         </li>
         
         <li>And it is not for any mortal that Allah should speak to them, they could not bear
            to
            hear and they did not see.
         </li>
         
         <li>And thus did We reveal to you an inspired book by Our command. You did not know what
            the Book was, nor (what) the faith (was), but We made it a light, guiding thereby
            whom We please of Our servants; and most surely you show the way to the right
            path:
         </li>
         
         <li>The path of Allah, Whose is whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the
            earth; now surely to Allah do all affairs eventually come.
         </li>
         
      </ul>
