      <h4>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </h4>
      <ul>
         
         
         
         
         <li>Surely We sent Nuh to his people, saying: Warn your people before there come upon
            them a painful chastisement.
         </li>
         
         <li>He said: O my people! Surely I am a plain warner to you:</li>
         
         <li>That you should serve Allah and be careful of (your duty to) Him and obey me:</li>
         
         <li>He will forgive you some of your faults and grant you a delay to an appointed term;
            surely the term of Allah when it comes is not postponed; did you but know!
         </li>
         
         <li>He said: O my Lord! surely I have called my people by night and by day!</li>
         
         <li>But my call has only made them flee the more:</li>
         
         <li>And whenever I have called them that Thou mayest forgive them, they put their fingers
            in their ears, cover themselves with their garments, and persist and are puffed up
            with pride:
         </li>
         
         <li>Then surely I called to them aloud:</li>
         
         <li>Then surely I spoke to them in public and I spoke to them in secret:</li>
         
         <li>Then I said, Ask forgiveness of your Lord, surely He is the most Forgiving:</li>
         
         <li>He will send down upon you the cloud, pouring down abundance of rain:</li>
         
         <li>And help you with wealth and sons, and make for you gardens, and make for you
            rivers.
         </li>
         
         <li>What is the matter with you that you fear not the greatness of Allah?</li>
         
         <li>And indeed He has created you through various grades:</li>
         
         <li>Do you not see how Allah has created the seven heavens, one above another,</li>
         
         <li>And made the moon therein a light, and made the sun a lamp?</li>
         
         <li>And Allah has made you grow out of the earth as a growth:</li>
         
         <li>Then He returns you to it, then will He bring you forth a (new) bringing forth:</li>
         
         <li>And Allah has made for you the earth a wide expanse,</li>
         
         <li>That you may go along therein in wide paths.</li>
         
         <li>Nuh said: My Lord! surely they have disobeyed me and followed him whose wealth and
            children have added to him nothing but loss.
         </li>
         
         <li>And they have planned a very great plan.</li>
         
         <li>And they say: By no means leave your gods, nor leave Wadd, nor Suwa; nor Yaghus, and
            Yauq and Nasr.
         </li>
         
         <li>And indeed they have led astray many, and do not increase the unjust in aught but
            error.
         </li>
         
         <li>Because of their wrongs they were drowned, then made to enter fire, so they did not
            find any helpers besides Allah.
         </li>
         
         <li>And Nuh said: My Lord! leave not upon the land any dweller from among the
            unbelievers:
         </li>
         
         <li>For surely if Thou leave them they will lead astray Thy servants, and will not beget
            any but immoral, ungrateful (children)
         </li>
         
         <li>My Lord! forgive me and my parents and him who enters my house believing, and the
            believing men and the believing women; and do not increase the unjust in aught but
            destruction!
         </li>
         
      </ul>
