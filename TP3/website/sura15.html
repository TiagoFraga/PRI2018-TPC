      <h4>In The Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful. </h4>
      <ul>
         
         
         
         
         <li>Alif Lam Ra. These are the verses of the Book and (of) a Quran that makes (things)
            clear.
         </li>
         
         <li>Often will those who disbelieve wish that they had been Muslims.</li>
         
         <li>Leave them that they may eat and enjoy themselves and (that) hope may beguile them,
            for they will soon know.
         </li>
         
         <li>And never did We destroy a town but it had a term made known.</li>
         
         <li>No people can hasten on their doom nor can they postpone (it).</li>
         
         <li>And they say: O you to whom the Reminder has been revealed! you are most surely
            insane:
         </li>
         
         <li>Why do you not bring to us the angels if you are of the truthful ones?</li>
         
         <li>We do not send the angels but with truth, and then they would not be respited.</li>
         
         <li>Surely We have revealed the Reminder and We will most surely be its guardian.</li>
         
         <li>And certainly We sent (apostles) before you among the nations of yore.</li>
         
         <li>And there never came an apostle to them but they mocked him.</li>
         
         <li>Thus do We make it to enter into the hearts of the guilty;</li>
         
         <li>They do not believe in it, and indeed the example of the former people has already
            passed.
         </li>
         
         <li>And even if We open to them a gateway of heaven, so that they ascend into it all the
            while,
         </li>
         
         <li>They would certainly say: Only our eyes have been covered over, rather we are an
            enchanted people.
         </li>
         
         <li>And certainly We have made strongholds in the heaven and We have made it fair seeming
            to the beholders.
         </li>
         
         <li>And We guard it against every accursed Shaitan,</li>
         
         <li>But he who steals a hearing, so there follows him a visible flame.</li>
         
         <li>And the earth — We have spread it forth and made in it firm mountains and
            caused to grow in it of every suitable thing.
         </li>
         
         <li>And We have made in it means of subsistence for you and for him for whom you are not
            the suppliers.
         </li>
         
         <li>And there is not a thing but with Us are the treasures of it, and We do not send it
            down but in a known measure.
         </li>
         
         <li>And We send the winds fertilizing, then send down water from the cloud so We give
            it
            to you to drink of, nor is it you who store it up.
         </li>
         
         <li>And most surely We bring to life and cause to die and We are the heirs.</li>
         
         <li>And certainly We know those of you who have gone before and We certainly know those
            who shall come later.
         </li>
         
         <li>And surely your Lord will gather them together; surely He is Wise, Knowing.</li>
         
         <li>And certainly We created man of clay that gives forth sound, of black mud fashioned
            in shape.
         </li>
         
         <li>And the jinn We created before, of intensely hot fire.</li>
         
         <li>And when your Lord said to the angels: Surely I am going to create a mortal of the
            essence of black mud fashioned in shape.
         </li>
         
         <li>So when I have made him complete and breathed into him of My spirit, fall down making
            obeisance to him.
         </li>
         
         <li>So the angels made obeisance, all of them together,</li>
         
         <li>But Iblis (did it not); he refused to be with those who made obeisance.</li>
         
         <li>He said: O Iblis! what excuse have you that you are not with those who make
            obeisance?
         </li>
         
         <li>He said: I am not such that I should make obeisance to a mortal whom Thou hast
            created of the essence of black mud fashioned in shape.
         </li>
         
         <li>He said: Then get out of it, for surely you are driven away:</li>
         
         <li>And surely on you is curse until the day of judgment.</li>
         
         <li>He said: My Lord! then respite me till the time when they are raised.</li>
         
         <li>He said: So surely you are of the respited ones,</li>
         
         <li>Till the period of the time made known.</li>
         
         <li>He said: My Lord! because Thou hast made life evil to me, I will certainly make
            (evil) fair-seeming to them on earth, and I will certainly cause them all to
            deviate,
         </li>
         
         <li>Except Thy servants from among them, the devoted ones.</li>
         
         <li>He said: This is a right way with Me:</li>
         
         <li>Surely, as regards My servants, you have no authority over them except those who
            follow you of the deviators.
         </li>
         
         <li>And surely Hell is the promised place of them all:</li>
         
         <li>It has seven gates; for every gate there shall be a separate party of them.</li>
         
         <li>Surely those who guard (against evil) shall be in the midst of gardens and
            fountains:
         </li>
         
         <li>Enter them in peace, secure.</li>
         
         <li>And We will root out whatever of rancor is in their breasts — (they shall be)
            as brethren, on raised couches, face to face.
         </li>
         
         <li>Toil shall not afflict them in it, nor shall they be ever ejected from it.</li>
         
         <li>Inform My servants that I am the Forgiving, the Merciful,</li>
         
         <li>And that My punishment — that is the painful punishment.</li>
         
         <li>And inform them of the guests of Ibrahim:</li>
         
         <li>When they entered upon him, they said, Peace. He said: Surely we are afraid of
            you.
         </li>
         
         <li>They said: Be not afraid, surely we give you the good news of a boy, possessing
            knowledge.
         </li>
         
         <li>He said: Do you give me good news (of a son) when old age has come upon me? —
            Of what then do you give me good news!
         </li>
         
         <li>They said: We give you good news with truth, therefore be not of the despairing.</li>
         
         <li>He said: And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord but the erring ones?</li>
         
         <li>He said: What is your business then, O messengers?</li>
         
         <li>They said: Surely we are sent towards a guilty people,</li>
         
         <li>Except Lut's followers: We will most surely deliver them all,</li>
         
         <li>Except his wife; We ordained that she shall surely be of those who remain behind.</li>
         
         <li>So when the messengers came to Lut's followers,</li>
         
         <li>He said: Surely you are an unknown people.</li>
         
         <li>They said: Nay, we have come to you with that about which they disputed.</li>
         
         <li>And we have come to you with the truth, and we are most surely truthful.</li>
         
         <li>Therefore go forth with your followers in a part of the night and yourself follow
            their rear, and let not any one of you turn round, and go forth whither you are
            commanded.
         </li>
         
         <li>And We revealed to him this decree, that the roots of these shall be cut off in the
            morning.
         </li>
         
         <li>And the people of the town came rejoicing.</li>
         
         <li>He said: Surely these are my guests, therefore do not disgrace me,</li>
         
         <li>And guard against (the punishment of) Allah and do not put me to shame.</li>
         
         <li>They said: Have we not forbidden you from (other) people?</li>
         
         <li>He said: These are my daughters, if you will do (aught).</li>
         
         <li>By your life! they were blindly wandering on in their intoxication.</li>
         
         <li>So the rumbling overtook them (while) entering upon the time of sunrise;</li>
         
         <li>Thus did We turn it upside down, and rained down upon them stones of what had been
            decreed.
         </li>
         
         <li>Surely in this are signs for those who examine.</li>
         
         <li>And surely it is on a road that still abides.</li>
         
         <li>Most surely there is a sign in this for the believers.</li>
         
         <li>And the dwellers of the thicket also were most surely unjust.</li>
         
         <li>So We inflicted retribution on them, and they are both, indeed, on an open road
            (still) pursued.
         </li>
         
         <li>And the dwellers of the Rock certainly rejected the messengers;</li>
         
         <li>And We gave them Our communications, but they turned aside from them;</li>
         
         <li>And they hewed houses in the mountains in security.</li>
         
         <li>So the rumbling overtook them in the morning;</li>
         
         <li>And what they earned did not avail them.</li>
         
         <li>And We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them two but in
            truth; and the hour is most surely coming, so turn away with kindly forgiveness.
         </li>
         
         <li>Surely your Lord is the Creator of all things, the Knowing.</li>
         
         <li>And certainly We have given you seven of the oft-repeated (verses) and the grand
            Quran.
         </li>
         
         <li>Do not strain your eyes after what We have given certain classes of them to enjoy,
            and do not grieve for them, and make yourself gentle to the believers.
         </li>
         
         <li>And say: Surely I am the plain warner.</li>
         
         <li>Like as We sent down on the dividers,</li>
         
         <li>Those who made the Quran into shreds.</li>
         
         <li>So, by your Lord, We would most certainly question them all,</li>
         
         <li>As to what they did.</li>
         
         <li>Therefore declare openly what you are bidden and turn aside from the polytheists.</li>
         
         <li>Surely We will suffice you against the scoffers,</li>
         
         <li>Those who set up another god with Allah; so they shall soon know.</li>
         
         <li>And surely We know that your breast straitens at what they say;</li>
         
         <li>Therefore celebrate the praise of your Lord, and be of those who make obeisance.</li>
         
         <li>And serve your Lord until there comes to you that which is certain.</li>
