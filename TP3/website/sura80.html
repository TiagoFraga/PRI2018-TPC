      <h4>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </h4>
      <ul>
         
         
         
         
         <li>He frowned and turned (his) back,</li>
         
         <li>Because there came to him the blind man.</li>
         
         <li>And what would make you know that he would purify himself,</li>
         
         <li>Or become reminded so that the reminder should profit him?</li>
         
         <li>As for him who considers himself free from need (of you),</li>
         
         <li>To him do you address yourself.</li>
         
         <li>And no blame is on you if he would not purify himself.</li>
         
         <li>And as to him who comes to you striving hard,</li>
         
         <li>And he fears,</li>
         
         <li>From him will you divert yourself.</li>
         
         <li>Nay! surely it is an admonishment.</li>
         
         <li>So let him who pleases mind it.</li>
         
         <li>In honored books,</li>
         
         <li>Exalted, purified,</li>
         
         <li>In the hands of scribes,</li>
         
         <li>Noble, virtuous.</li>
         
         <li>Cursed be man! how ungrateful is he!</li>
         
         <li>Of what thing did He create him?</li>
         
         <li>Of a small seed; He created him, then He made him according to a measure,</li>
         
         <li>Then (as for) the way — He has made it easy (for him)</li>
         
         <li>Then He causes him to die, then assigns to him a grave,</li>
         
         <li>Then when He pleases, He will raise him to life again.</li>
         
         <li>Nay; but he has not done what He bade him.</li>
         
         <li>Then let man look to his food,</li>
         
         <li>That We pour down the water, pouring (it) down in abundance,</li>
         
         <li>Then We cleave the earth, cleaving (it) asunder,</li>
         
         <li>Then We cause to grow therein the grain,</li>
         
         <li>And grapes and clover,</li>
         
         <li>And the olive and the palm,</li>
         
         <li>And thick gardens,</li>
         
         <li>And fruits and herbage,</li>
         
         <li>A provision for you and for your cattle.</li>
         
         <li>But when the deafening cry comes,</li>
         
         <li>The day on which a man shall fly from his brother,</li>
         
         <li>And his mother and his father,</li>
         
         <li>And his spouse and his son — </li>
         
         <li>Every man of them shall on that day have an affair which will occupy him.</li>
         
         <li>(Many) faces on that day shall be bright,</li>
         
         <li>Laughing, joyous.</li>
         
         <li>And (many) faces on that day, on them shall be dust,</li>
         
         <li>Darkness shall cover them.</li>
         
         <li>These are they who are unbelievers, the wicked.</li>
         
      </ul>
