      <h4>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </h4>
      <ul>
         
         
         
         
         <li>I swear by the heaven and the comer by night;</li>
         
         <li>And what will make you know what the comer by night is?</li>
         
         <li>The star of piercing brightness;</li>
         
         <li>There is not a soul but over it is a keeper.</li>
         
         <li>So let man consider of what he is created:</li>
         
         <li>He is created of water pouring forth,</li>
         
         <li>Coming from between the back and the ribs.</li>
         
         <li>Most surely He is able to return him (to life).</li>
         
         <li>On the day when hidden things shall be made manifest,</li>
         
         <li>He shall have neither strength nor helper.</li>
         
         <li>I swear by the raingiving heavens,</li>
         
         <li>And the earth splitting (with plants);</li>
         
         <li>Most surely it is a decisive word,</li>
         
         <li>And it is no joke.</li>
         
         <li>Surely they will make a scheme,</li>
         
         <li>And I (too) will make a scheme.</li>
         
         <li>So grant the unbelievers a respite: let them alone for a while.</li>
         
      </ul>
