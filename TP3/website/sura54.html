      <h4>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent the Merciful. </h4>
      <ul>
         
         
         
         
         <li>The hour drew nigh and the moon did rend asunder.</li>
         
         <li>And if they see a miracle they turn aside and say: Transient magic.</li>
         
         <li>And they call (it) a lie, and follow their low desires; and every affair has its
            appointed term.
         </li>
         
         <li>And certainly some narratives have come to them wherein is prevention — </li>
         
         <li>Consummate wisdom — but warnings do not avail;</li>
         
         <li>So turn (your) back on them (for) the day when the inviter shall invite them to a
            hard task,
         </li>
         
         <li>Their eyes cast down, going forth from their graves as if they were scattered
            locusts,
         </li>
         
         <li>Hastening to the inviter. The unbelievers shall say: This is a hard day.</li>
         
         <li>Before them the people of Nuh rejected, so they rejected Our servant and called (him)
            mad, and he was driven away.
         </li>
         
         <li>Therefore he called upon his Lord: I am overcome, come Thou then to help.</li>
         
         <li>So We opened the gates of the cloud with water pouring down,</li>
         
         <li>And We made water to flow forth in the land in springs, so the water gathered
            together according to a measure already ordained.
         </li>
         
         <li>And We bore him on that which was made of planks and nails,</li>
         
         <li>Sailing, before Our eyes, a reward for him who was denied.</li>
         
         <li>And certainly We left it as a sign, but is there anyone who will mind?</li>
         
         <li>How (great) was then My punishment and My warning!</li>
         
         <li>And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who
            will mind?
         </li>
         
         <li>Ad treated (the truth) as a lie, so how (great) was My punishment and My warning!</li>
         
         <li>Surely We sent on them a tornado in a day of bitter ill-luck,</li>
         
         <li>Tearing men away as if they were the trunks of palm-trees torn up.</li>
         
         <li>How (great) was then My punishment and My warning!</li>
         
         <li>And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who
            will mind?
         </li>
         
         <li>Samood rejected the warning.</li>
         
         <li>So they said: What! a single mortal from among us! Shall we follow him? Most surely
            we shall in that case be in sure error and distress:
         </li>
         
         <li>Has the reminder been made to light upon him from among us? Nay! he is an insolent
            liar!
         </li>
         
         <li>Tomorrow shall they know who is the liar, the insolent one.</li>
         
         <li>Surely We are going to send the she-camel as a trial for them; therefore watch them
            and have patience.
         </li>
         
         <li>And inform them that the water is shared between them; every share of the water shall
            be regulated.
         </li>
         
         <li>But they called their companion, so he took (the sword) and slew (her).</li>
         
         <li>How (great) was then My punishment and My warning!</li>
         
         <li>Surely We sent upon them a single cry, so they were like the dry fragments of trees
            which the maker of an enclosure collects.
         </li>
         
         <li>And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who
            will mind?
         </li>
         
         <li>The people of Lut treated the warning. as a lie.</li>
         
         <li>Surely We sent upon them a stonestorm, except Lut's followers; We saved them a little
            before daybreak,
         </li>
         
         <li>A favor from Us; thus do We reward him who gives thanks.</li>
         
         <li>And certainly he warned them of Our violent seizure, but they obstinately disputed
            the warning.
         </li>
         
         <li>And certainly they endeavored to turn him from his guests, but We blinded their eyes;
            so taste My chastisement and My warning.
         </li>
         
         <li>And certainly a lasting chastisement overtook them in the morning.</li>
         
         <li>So taste My chastisement and My warning.</li>
         
         <li>And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who
            will mind?
         </li>
         
         <li>And certainly the warning came to Firon's people.</li>
         
         <li>They rejected all Our communications, so We overtook them after the manner of a
            Mighty, Powerful One.
         </li>
         
         <li>Are the unbelievers of yours better than these, or is there an exemption for you in
            the scriptures?
         </li>
         
         <li>Or do they say: We are a host allied together to help each other?</li>
         
         <li>Soon shall the hosts be routed, and they shall turn (their) backs.</li>
         
         <li>Nay, the hour is their promised time, and the hour shall be most grievous and
            bitter.
         </li>
         
         <li>Surely the guilty are in error and distress.</li>
         
         <li>On the day when they shall be dragged upon their faces into the fire; taste the touch
            of hell.
         </li>
         
         <li>Surely We have created everything according to a measure.</li>
         
         <li>And Our command is but one, as the twinkling of an eye.</li>
         
         <li>And certainly We have already destroyed the likes of you, but is there anyone who
            will mind?
         </li>
         
         <li>And everything they have done is in the writings.</li>
         
         <li>And everything small and great is written down.</li>
         
         <li>Surely those who guard (against evil) shall be in gardens and rivers,</li>
         
         <li>In the seat of honor with a most Powerful King.</li>
         
      </ul>
