      <h4>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </h4>
      <ul>
         
         
         
         
         <li>I swear by the daybreak,</li>
         
         <li>And the ten nights,</li>
         
         <li>And the even and the odd,</li>
         
         <li>And the night when it departs.</li>
         
         <li>Truly in that there is an oath for those who possess understanding.</li>
         
         <li>Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with Ad,</li>
         
         <li>(The people of) Aram, possessors of lofty buildings,</li>
         
         <li>The like of which were not created in the (other) cities;</li>
         
         <li>And (with) Samood, who hewed out the rocks in the valley,</li>
         
         <li>And (with) Firon, the lord of hosts,</li>
         
         <li>Who committed inordinacy in the cities,</li>
         
         <li>So they made great mischief therein?</li>
         
         <li>Therefore your Lord let down upon them a portion of the chastisement.</li>
         
         <li>Most surely your Lord is watching.</li>
         
         <li>And as for man, when his Lord tries him, then treats him with honor and makes him
            lead an easy life, he says: My Lord honors me.
         </li>
         
         <li>But when He tries him (differently), then straitens to him his means of subsistence,
            he says: My Lord has disgraced me.
         </li>
         
         <li>Nay! but you do not honor the orphan,</li>
         
         <li>Nor do you urge one another to feed the poor,</li>
         
         <li>And you eat away the heritage, devouring (everything) indiscriminately,</li>
         
         <li>And you love wealth with exceeding love.</li>
         
         <li>Nay! when the earth is made to crumble to pieces,</li>
         
         <li>And your Lord comes and (also) the angels in ranks,</li>
         
         <li>And hell is made to appear on that day. On that day shall man be mindful, and what
            shall being mindful (then) avail him?
         </li>
         
         <li>He shall say: O! would that I had sent before for (this) my life!</li>
         
         <li>But on that day shall no one chastise with (anything like) His chastisement,</li>
         
         <li>And no one shall bind with (anything like) His binding.</li>
         
         <li>O soul that art at rest!</li>
         
         <li>Return to your Lord, well-pleased (with him), well-pleasing (Him),</li>
         
         <li>So enter among My servants,</li>
         
         <li>And enter into My garden.</li>
         
      </ul>
