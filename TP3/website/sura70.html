      <h4>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </h4>
      <ul>
         
         
         
         
         <li>One demanding, demanded the chastisement which must befall</li>
         
         <li>The unbelievers — there is none to avert it — </li>
         
         <li>From Allah, the Lord of the ways of Ascent.</li>
         
         <li>To Him ascend the angels and the Spirit in a day the measure of which is fifty
            thousand years.
         </li>
         
         <li>Therefore endure with a goodly patience.</li>
         
         <li>Surely they think it to be far off,</li>
         
         <li>And We see it nigh.</li>
         
         <li>On the day when the heaven shall be as molten copper,</li>
         
         <li>And the mountains shall be as tufts of wool;</li>
         
         <li>And friend shall not ask of friend,</li>
         
         <li>(Though) they shall be made to see each other. The guilty one would fain redeem
            himself from the chastisement of that day by (sacrificing) his children,
         </li>
         
         <li>And his wife and his brother,</li>
         
         <li>And the nearest of his kinsfolk who gave him shelter,</li>
         
         <li>And all those that are in the earth, (wishing) then (that) this might deliver
            him.
         </li>
         
         <li>By no means! Surely it is a flaming fire,</li>
         
         <li>Dragging by the head,</li>
         
         <li>It shall claim him who turned and fled (from truth),</li>
         
         <li>And amasses (wealth) then shuts it up.</li>
         
         <li>Surely man is created of a hasty temperament;</li>
         
         <li>Being greatly grieved when evil afflicts him</li>
         
         <li>And niggardly when good befalls him</li>
         
         <li>Except those who pray,</li>
         
         <li>Those who are constant at their prayer,</li>
         
         <li>And those in whose wealth there is a fixed portion.</li>
         
         <li>For him who begs and for him who is denied (good)</li>
         
         <li>And those who accept the truth of the judgment day,</li>
         
         <li>And those who are fearful of the chastisement of their Lord — </li>
         
         <li>Surely the chastisement of their Lord is (a thing) not to be felt secure of — </li>
         
         <li>And those who guard their private parts,</li>
         
         <li>Except in the case of their wives or those whom their right hands possess — for
            these surely are not to be blamed,
         </li>
         
         <li>But he who seeks to go beyond this, these it is that go beyond the limits — </li>
         
         <li>And those who are faithful to their trusts and their covenant,</li>
         
         <li>And those who are upright in their testimonies,</li>
         
         <li>And those who keep a guard on their prayer,</li>
         
         <li>Those shall be in gardens, honored.</li>
         
         <li>But what is the matter with those who disbelieve that they hasten on around you,</li>
         
         <li>On the right hand and on the left, in sundry parties?</li>
         
         <li>Does every man of them desire that he should be made to enter the garden of
            bliss?
         </li>
         
         <li>By no means! Surely We have created them of what they know.</li>
         
         <li>But nay! I swear by the Lord of the Easts and the Wests that We are certainly
            able
         </li>
         
         <li>To bring instead (others) better than them, and We shall not be overcome.</li>
         
         <li>Therefore leave them alone to go on with the false discourses and to sport until they
            come face to face with that day of theirs with which they are threatened;
         </li>
         
         <li>The day on which they shall come forth from their graves in haste, as if they were
            hastening on to a goal,
         </li>
         
         <li>Their eyes cast down; disgrace shall overtake them; that is the day which they were
            threatened with.
         </li>
         
      </ul>
