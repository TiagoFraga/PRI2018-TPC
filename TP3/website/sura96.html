      <h4>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </h4>
      <ul>
         
         
         
         
         <li>Read in the name of your Lord Who created.</li>
         
         <li>He created man from a clot.</li>
         
         <li>Read and your Lord is Most Honorable,</li>
         
         <li>Who taught (to write) with the pen,</li>
         
         <li>Taught man what he knew not.</li>
         
         <li>Nay! man is most surely inordinate,</li>
         
         <li>Because he sees himself free from want.</li>
         
         <li>Surely to your Lord is the return.</li>
         
         <li>Have you seen him who forbids</li>
         
         <li>A servant when he prays?</li>
         
         <li>Have you considered if he were on the right way,</li>
         
         <li>Or enjoined guarding (against evil)?</li>
         
         <li>Have you considered if he gives the lie to the truth and turns (his) back?</li>
         
         <li>Does he not know that Allah does see?</li>
         
         <li>Nay! if he desist not, We would certainly smite his forehead,</li>
         
         <li>A lying, sinful forehead.</li>
         
         <li>Then let him summon his council,</li>
         
         <li>We too would summon the braves of the army.</li>
         
         <li>Nay! obey him not, and make obeisance and draw nigh (to Allah).</li>
