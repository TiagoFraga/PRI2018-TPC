      <h4>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </h4>
      <ul>
         
         
         
         
         <li>The Beneficent God,</li>
         
         <li>Taught the Quran.</li>
         
         <li>He created man,</li>
         
         <li>Taught him the mode of expression.</li>
         
         <li>The sun and the moon follow a reckoning.</li>
         
         <li>And the herbs and the trees do adore (Him).</li>
         
         <li>And the heaven, He raised it high, and He made the balance,</li>
         
         <li>That you may not be inordinate in respect of the measure.</li>
         
         <li>And keep up the balance with equity and do not make the measure deficient.</li>
         
         <li>And the earth, He has set it for living creatures;</li>
         
         <li>Therein is fruit and palms having sheathed clusters,</li>
         
         <li>And the grain with (its) husk and fragrance.</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>He created man from dry clay like earthen vessels,</li>
         
         <li>And He created the jinn of a flame of fire.</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>Lord of the East and Lord of the West.</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>He has made the two seas to flow freely (so that) they meet together:</li>
         
         <li>Between them is a barrier which they cannot pass.</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>There come forth from them pearls, both large and small.</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>And His are the ships reared aloft in the sea like mountains.</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>Everyone on it must pass away.</li>
         
         <li>And there will endure for ever the person of your Lord, the Lord of glory and
            honor.
         </li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>All those who are in the heavens and the earth ask of Him; every moment He is in a
            state (of glory).
         </li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>Soon will We apply Ourselves to you, O you two armies.</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>O assembly of the jinn and the men! If you are able to pass through the regions of
            the heavens and the earth, then pass through; you cannot pass through but with
            authority.
         </li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>The flames of fire and smoke will be sent on you two, then you will not be able to
            defend yourselves.
         </li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>And when the heaven is rent asunder, and then becomes red like red hide.</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>So on that day neither man nor jinni shall be asked about his sin.</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>The guilty shall be recognized by their marks, so they shall be seized by the
            forelocks and the feet.
         </li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>This is the hell which the guilty called a lie.</li>
         
         <li>Round about shall they go between it and hot, boiling water.</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>And for him who fears to stand before his Lord are two gardens.</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>Having in them various kinds.</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>In both of them are two fountains flowing.</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>In both of them are two pairs of every fruit.</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>Reclining on beds, the inner coverings of which are of silk brocade; and the fruits
            of the two gardens shall be within reach.
         </li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>In them shall be those who restrained their eyes; before them neither man nor jinni
            shall have touched them.
         </li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>As though they were rubies and pearls.</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>Is the reward of goodness aught but goodness?</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>And besides these two are two (other) gardens:</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>Both inclining to blackness.</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>In both of them are two springs gushing forth.</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>In both are fruits and palms and pomegranates.</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>In them are goodly things, beautiful ones.</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>Pure ones confined to the pavilions.</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>Man has not touched them before them nor jinni.</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>Reclining on green cushions and beautiful carpets.</li>
         
         <li>Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?</li>
         
         <li>Blessed be the name of your Lord, the Lord of Glory and Honor!</li>
