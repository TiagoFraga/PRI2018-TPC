      <h4>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </h4>
      <ul>
         
         
         
         
         <li>I swear by the sun and its brilliance,</li>
         
         <li>And the moon when it follows the sun,</li>
         
         <li>And the day when it shows it,</li>
         
         <li>And the night when it draws a veil over it,</li>
         
         <li>And the heaven and Him Who made it,</li>
         
         <li>And the earth and Him Who extended it,</li>
         
         <li>And the soul and Him Who made it perfect,</li>
         
         <li>Then He inspired it to understand what is right and wrong for it;</li>
         
         <li>He will indeed be successful who purifies it,</li>
         
         <li>And he will indeed fail who corrupts it.</li>
         
         <li>Samood gave the lie (to the truth) in their inordinacy,</li>
         
         <li>When the most unfortunate of them broke forth with mischief,</li>
         
         <li>So Allah's apostle said to them (Leave alone) Allah's she-camel, and (give) her (to)
            drink.
         </li>
         
         <li>But they called him a liar and slaughtered her, therefore their Lord crushed them
            for
            their sin and levelled them (with the ground).
         </li>
         
         <li>And He fears not its consequence.</li>
         
      </ul>
