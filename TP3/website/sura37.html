      <h4>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </h4>
      <ul>
         
         
         
         
         <li>I swear by those who draw themselves out in ranks,</li>
         
         <li>Then those who drive away with reproof,</li>
         
         <li>Then those who recite, being mindful,</li>
         
         <li>Most surely your God is One:</li>
         
         <li>The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and Lord of the
            easts.
         </li>
         
         <li>Surely We have adorned the nearest heaven with an adornment, the stars,</li>
         
         <li>And (there is) a safeguard against every rebellious Shaitan.</li>
         
         <li>They cannot listen to the exalted assembly and they are thrown at from every
            side,
         </li>
         
         <li>Being driven off, and for them is a perpetual chastisement,</li>
         
         <li>Except him who snatches off but once, then there follows him a brightly shining
            flame.
         </li>
         
         <li>Then ask them whether they are stronger in creation or those (others) whom We have
            created. Surely We created them of firm clay.
         </li>
         
         <li>Nay! you wonder while they mock,</li>
         
         <li>And when they are reminded, they mind not,</li>
         
         <li>And when they see a sign they incite one another to scoff,</li>
         
         <li>And they say: This is nothing but clear magic:</li>
         
         <li>What! when we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then certainly be
            raised,
         </li>
         
         <li>Or our fathers of yore?</li>
         
         <li>Say: Aye! and you shall be abject.</li>
         
         <li>So it shall only be a single cry, when lo! they shall see.</li>
         
         <li>And they shall say: O woe to us! this is the day of requital.</li>
         
         <li>This is the day of the judgment which you called a lie.</li>
         
         <li>Gather together those who were unjust and their associates, and what they used to
            worship
         </li>
         
         <li>Besides Allah, then lead them to the way to hell.</li>
         
         <li>And stop them, for they shall be questioned:</li>
         
         <li>What is the matter with you that you do not help each other?</li>
         
         <li>Nay! on that day they shall be submissive.</li>
         
         <li>And some of them shall advance towards others, questioning each other.</li>
         
         <li>They shall say: Surely you used to come to us from the right side.</li>
         
         <li>They shall say: Nay, you (yourselves) were not believers;</li>
         
         <li>And we had no authority over you, but you were an inordinate people;</li>
         
         <li>So the sentence of our Lord has come to pass against us: (now) we shall surely
            taste;
         </li>
         
         <li>So we led you astray, for we ourselves were erring.</li>
         
         <li>So they shall on that day be sharers in the chastisement one with another.</li>
         
         <li>Surely thus do We deal with the guilty.</li>
         
         <li>Surely they used to behave proudly when it was said to them: There is no god but
            Allah;
         </li>
         
         <li>And to say: What! shall we indeed give up our gods for the sake of a mad poet?</li>
         
         <li>Nay: he has come with the truth and verified the apostles.</li>
         
         <li>Most surely you will taste the painful punishment.</li>
         
         <li>And you shall not be rewarded except (for) what you did.</li>
         
         <li>Save the servants of Allah, the purified ones.</li>
         
         <li>For them is a known sustenance,</li>
         
         <li>Fruits, and they shall be highly honored,</li>
         
         <li>In gardens of pleasure,</li>
         
         <li>On thrones, facing each other.</li>
         
         <li>A bowl shall be made to go round them from water running out of springs,</li>
         
         <li>White, delicious to those who drink.</li>
         
         <li>There shall be no trouble in it, nor shall they be exhausted therewith.</li>
         
         <li>And with them shall be those who restrain the eyes, having beautiful eyes;</li>
         
         <li>As if they were eggs carefully protected.</li>
         
         <li>Then shall some of them advance to others, questioning each other.</li>
         
         <li>A speaker from among them shall say: Surely I had a comrade of mine,</li>
         
         <li>Who said: What! are you indeed of those who accept (the truth)?</li>
         
         <li>What! when we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then be certainly
            brought to judgment?
         </li>
         
         <li>He shall say: Will you look on?</li>
         
         <li>Then he looked down and saw him in the midst of hell.</li>
         
         <li>He shall say: By Allah! you had almost caused me to perish;</li>
         
         <li>And had it not been for the favor of my Lord, I would certainly have been among those
            brought up.
         </li>
         
         <li>Is it then that we are not going to die,</li>
         
         <li>Except our previous death? And we shall not be chastised?</li>
         
         <li>Most surely this is the mighty achievement.</li>
         
         <li>For the like of this then let the workers work.</li>
         
         <li>Is this better as an entertainment or the tree of Zaqqum?</li>
         
         <li>Surely We have made it to be a trial to the unjust.</li>
         
         <li>Surely it is a tree that-grows in the bottom of the hell;</li>
         
         <li>Its produce is as it were the heads of the serpents.</li>
         
         <li>Then most surely they shall eat of it and fill (their) bellies with it.</li>
         
         <li>Then most surely they shall have after it to drink of a mixture prepared in boiling
            water.
         </li>
         
         <li>Then most surely their return shall be to hell.</li>
         
         <li>Surely they found their fathers going astray,</li>
         
         <li>So in their footsteps they are being hastened on.</li>
         
         <li>And certainly most of the ancients went astray before them,</li>
         
         <li>And certainly We sent among them warners.</li>
         
         <li>Then see how was the end of those warned,</li>
         
         <li>Except the servants of Allah, the purified ones.</li>
         
         <li>And Nuh did certainly call upon Us, and most excellent answerer of prayer are We.</li>
         
         <li>And We delivered him and his followers from the mighty distress.</li>
         
         <li>And We made his offspring the survivors.</li>
         
         <li>And We perpetuated to him (praise) among the later generations.</li>
         
         <li>Peace and salutation to Nuh among the nations.</li>
         
         <li>Thus do We surely reward the doers of good.</li>
         
         <li>Surely he was of Our believing servants.</li>
         
         <li>Then We drowned the others.</li>
         
         <li>And most surely Ibrahim followed his way.</li>
         
         <li>When he came to his Lord with a free heart,</li>
         
         <li>When he said to his father and his people: What is it that you worship?</li>
         
         <li>A lie — gods besides Allah — do you desire?</li>
         
         <li>What is then your idea about the Lord of the worlds?</li>
         
         <li>Then he looked at the stars, looking up once,</li>
         
         <li>Then he said: Surely I am sick (of your worshipping these).</li>
         
         <li>So they went away from him, turning back.</li>
         
         <li>Then he turned aside to their gods secretly and said: What! do you not eat?</li>
         
         <li>What is the matter with you that you do not speak?</li>
         
         <li>Then he turned against them secretly, smiting them with the right hand.</li>
         
         <li>So they (people) advanced towards him, hastening.</li>
         
         <li>Said he: What! do you worship what you hew out?</li>
         
         <li>And Allah has created you and what you make.</li>
         
         <li>They said: Build for him a furnace, then cast him into the burning fire.</li>
         
         <li>And they desired a war against him, but We brought them low.</li>
         
         <li>And he said: Surely I fly to my lord; He will guide me.</li>
         
         <li>My Lord! grant me of the doers of good deeds.</li>
         
         <li>So We gave him the good news of a boy, possessing forbearance.</li>
         
         <li>And when he attained to working with him, he said: O my son! surely I have seen in
            a
            dream that I should sacrifice you; consider then what you see. He said: O my father!
            do what you are commanded; if Allah please, you will find me of the patient
            ones.
         </li>
         
         <li>So when they both submitted and he threw him down upon his forehead,</li>
         
         <li>And We called out to him saying: O Ibrahim!</li>
         
         <li>You have indeed shown the truth of the vision; surely thus do We reward the doers
            of
            good:
         </li>
         
         <li>Most surely this is a manifest trial.</li>
         
         <li>And We ransomed him with a Feat sacrifice.</li>
         
         <li>And We perpetuated (praise) to him among the later generations.</li>
         
         <li>Peace be on Ibrahim.</li>
         
         <li>Thus do We reward the doers of good.</li>
         
         <li>Surely he was one of Our believing servants.</li>
         
         <li>And We gave him the good news of Ishaq, a prophet among the good ones.</li>
         
         <li>And We showered Our blessings on him and on Ishaq; and of their offspring are the
            doers of good, and (also) those who are clearly unjust to their own souls.
         </li>
         
         <li>And certainly We conferred a favor on Musa and Haroun.</li>
         
         <li>And We delivered them both and their people from the mighty distress.</li>
         
         <li>And We helped them, so they were the vanquishers.</li>
         
         <li>And We gave them both the Book that made (things) clear.</li>
         
         <li>And We guided them both on the right way.</li>
         
         <li>And We perpetuated (praise) to them among the later generations.</li>
         
         <li>Peace be on Musa and Haroun.</li>
         
         <li>Even thus do We reward the doers of good.</li>
         
         <li>Surely they were both of Our believing servants.</li>
         
         <li>And Ilyas was most surely of the apostles.</li>
         
         <li>When he said to his people: Do you not guard (against evil)?</li>
         
         <li>What! do you call upon Ba'l and forsake the best of the creators,</li>
         
         <li>Allah, your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of yore?</li>
         
         <li>But they called him a liar, therefore they shall most surely be brought up.</li>
         
         <li>But not the servants of Allah, the purified ones.</li>
         
         <li>And We perpetuated to him (praise) among the later generations.</li>
         
         <li>Peace be on Ilyas.</li>
         
         <li>Even thus do We reward the doers of good.</li>
         
         <li>Surely he was one of Our believing servants.</li>
         
         <li>And Lut was most surely of the apostles.</li>
         
         <li>When We delivered him and his followers, all — </li>
         
         <li>Except an old woman (who was) amongst those who tarried.</li>
         
         <li>Then We destroyed the others.</li>
         
         <li>And most surely you pass by them in the morning,</li>
         
         <li>And at night; do you not then understand?</li>
         
         <li>And Yunus was most surely of the apostles.</li>
         
         <li>When he ran away to a ship completely laden,</li>
         
         <li>So he shared (with them), but was of those who are cast off.</li>
         
         <li>So the fish swallowed him while he did that for which he blamed himself.</li>
         
         <li>But had it not been that he was of those who glorify (Us),</li>
         
         <li>He would certainly have tarried in its belly to the day when they are raised.</li>
         
         <li>Then We cast him on to the vacant surface of the earth while he was sick.</li>
         
         <li>And We caused to grow up for him a gourdplant.</li>
         
         <li>And We sent him to a hundred thousand, rather they exceeded.</li>
         
         <li>And they believed, so We gave them provision till a time.</li>
         
         <li>Then ask them whether your Lord has daughters and they have sons.</li>
         
         <li>Or did We create the angels females while they were witnesses?</li>
         
         <li>Now surely it is of their own lie that they say:</li>
         
         <li>Allah has begotten; and most surely they are liars.</li>
         
         <li>Has He chosen daughters in preference to sons?</li>
         
         <li>What is the matter with you, how is it that you judge?</li>
         
         <li>Will you not then mind?</li>
         
         <li>Or have you a clear authority?</li>
         
         <li>Then bring your book, if you are truthful.</li>
         
         <li>And they assert a relationship between Him and the jinn; and certainly the jinn do
            know that they shall surely be brought up;
         </li>
         
         <li>Glory be to Allah (for freedom) from what they describe;</li>
         
         <li>But not so the servants of Allah, the purified ones.</li>
         
         <li>So surely you and what you worship,</li>
         
         <li>Not against Him can you cause (any) to fall into trial,</li>
         
         <li>Save him who will go to hell.</li>
         
         <li>And there is none of us but has an assigned place,</li>
         
         <li>And most surely we are they who draw themselves out in ranks,</li>
         
         <li>And we are most surely they who declare the glory (of Allah).</li>
         
         <li>And surely they used to say:</li>
         
         <li>Had we a reminder from those of yore,</li>
         
         <li>We would certainly have been the servants of Allah — the purified ones.</li>
         
         <li>But (now) they disbelieve in it, so they will come to know.</li>
         
         <li>And certainly Our word has already gone forth in respect of Our servants, the
            apostles:
         </li>
         
         <li>Most surely they shall be the assisted ones,</li>
         
         <li>And most surely Our host alone shall be the victorious ones.</li>
         
         <li>Therefore turn away from them till a time,</li>
         
         <li>And (then) see them, so they too shall see.</li>
         
         <li>What! would they then hasten on Our chastisement?</li>
         
         <li>But when it shall descend in their court, evil shall then be the morning of the
            warned ones.
         </li>
         
         <li>And turn away from them till a time,</li>
         
         <li>And (then) see, for they too shall see.</li>
         
         <li>Glory be to your Lord, the Lord of Honor, above what they describe.</li>
         
         <li>And peace be on the apostles.</li>
         
         <li>And all praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.</li>
