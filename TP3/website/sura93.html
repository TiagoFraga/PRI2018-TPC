      <h4>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </h4>
      <ul>
         
         
         
         
         <li>I swear by the early hours of the day,</li>
         
         <li>And the night when it covers with darkness.</li>
         
         <li>Your Lord has not forsaken you, nor has He become displeased,</li>
         
         <li>And surely what comes after is better for you than that which has gone before.</li>
         
         <li>And soon will your Lord give you so that you shall be well pleased.</li>
         
         <li>Did He not find you an orphan and give you shelter?</li>
         
         <li>And find you lost (i.e. unrecognized by men) and guide (them to you)?</li>
         
         <li>And find you in want and make you to be free from want?</li>
         
         <li>Therefore, as for the orphan, do not oppress (him).</li>
         
         <li>And as for him who asks, do not chide (him),</li>
         
         <li>And as for the favor of your Lord, do announce (it).</li>
         
      </ul>
