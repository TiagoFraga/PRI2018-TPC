      <h4>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </h4>
      <ul>
         
         
         
         
         <li>Woe to the defrauders,</li>
         
         <li>Who, when they take the measure (of their dues) from men take it fully,</li>
         
         <li>But when they measure out to others or weigh out for them, they are deficient.</li>
         
         <li>Do not these think that they shall be raised again,</li>
         
         <li>For a mighty day,</li>
         
         <li>The day on which men shall stand before the Lord of the worlds?</li>
         
         <li>Nay! most surely the record of the wicked is in the Sijjin.</li>
         
         <li>And what will make you know what the Sijjin is?</li>
         
         <li>It is a written book.</li>
         
         <li>Woe on that day to the rejecters,</li>
         
         <li>Who give the lie to the day of judgment.</li>
         
         <li>And none gives the lie to it but every exceeder of limits, sinful one;</li>
         
         <li>When Our communications are recited to him, he says: Stories of those of yore.</li>
         
         <li>Nay! rather, what they used to do has become like rust . upon their hearts.</li>
         
         <li>Nay! most surely they shall on that day be debarred from their Lord.</li>
         
         <li>Then most surely they shall enter the burning fire.</li>
         
         <li>Then shall it be said: This is what you gave the lie to.</li>
         
         <li>Nay! Most surely the record of the righteous shall be in the Iliyin.</li>
         
         <li>And what will make you know what the highest Iliyin is?</li>
         
         <li>It is a written book,</li>
         
         <li>Those who are drawn near (to Allah) shall witness it.</li>
         
         <li>Most surely the righteous shall be in bliss,</li>
         
         <li>On thrones, they shall gaze;</li>
         
         <li>You will recognize in their faces the brightness of bliss.</li>
         
         <li>They are made to quaff of a pure drink that is sealed (to others).</li>
         
         <li>The sealing of it is (with) musk; and for that let the aspirers aspire.</li>
         
         <li>And the admixture of it is a water of Tasnim,</li>
         
         <li>A fountain from which drink they who are drawn near (to Allah).</li>
         
         <li>Surely they who are guilty used to laugh at those who believe.</li>
         
         <li>And when they passed by them, they winked at one another.</li>
         
         <li>And when they returned to their own followers they returned exulting.</li>
         
         <li>And when they saw them, they said: Most surely these are in error;</li>
         
         <li>And they were not sent to be keepers over them.</li>
         
         <li>So today those who believe shall laugh at the unbelievers;</li>
         
         <li>On thrones, they will look.</li>
         
         <li>Surely the disbelievers are rewarded as they did.</li>
