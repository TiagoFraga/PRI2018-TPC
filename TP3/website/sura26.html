      <h4>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </h4>
      <ul>
         
         
         
         
         <li>Ta Sin Mim.</li>
         
         <li>These are the verses of the Book that makes (things) clear.</li>
         
         <li>Perhaps you will kill yourself with grief because they do not believe.</li>
         
         <li>If We please, We should send down upon them a sign from the heaven so that their
            necks should stoop to it.
         </li>
         
         <li>And there does not come to them a new reminder from the Beneficent God but they turn
            aside from it.
         </li>
         
         <li>So they have indeed rejected (the truth), therefore the news of that which they mock
            shall soon come to them.
         </li>
         
         <li>Do they not see the earth, how many of every noble kind We have caused to grow in
            it?
         </li>
         
         <li>Most surely there is a sign in that, but most of them will not believe.</li>
         
         <li>And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.</li>
         
         <li>And when your Lord called out to Musa, saying: Go to the unjust people,</li>
         
         <li>The people of Firon: Will they not guard (against evil)?</li>
         
         <li>He said: O my Lord! surely I fear that they will reject me;</li>
         
         <li>And by breast straitens, and my tongue is not eloquent, therefore send Thou to Haroun
            (to help me);
         </li>
         
         <li>And they have a crime against me, therefore I fear that they may slay me.</li>
         
         <li>He said: By no means, so go you both with Our signs; surely We are with you,
            hearing;
         </li>
         
         <li>Then come to Firon and say: Surely we are the messengers of the Lord of the
            worlds:
         </li>
         
         <li>Then send with us the children of Israel.</li>
         
         <li>(Firon) said: Did we not bring you up as a child among us, and you tarried among us
            for (many) years of your life?
         </li>
         
         <li>And you did (that) deed of yours which you did, and you are one of the
            ungrateful.
         </li>
         
         <li>He said: I did it then while I was of those unable to see the right course;</li>
         
         <li>So I fled from you when I feared you, then my Lord granted me wisdom and made me of
            the apostles;
         </li>
         
         <li>And is it a favor of which you remind me that you have enslaved the children of
            Israel?
         </li>
         
         <li>Firon said: And what is the Lord of the worlds?</li>
         
         <li>He said: The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, if you would
            be sure.
         </li>
         
         <li>(Firon) said to those around him: Do you not hear?</li>
         
         <li>He said: Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of old.</li>
         
         <li>Said he: Most surely your Apostle who is sent to you is mad.</li>
         
         <li>He said: The Lord of the east and the west and what is between them, if you
            understand.
         </li>
         
         <li>Said he: If you will take a god besides me, I will most certainly make you one of
            the
            imprisoned.
         </li>
         
         <li>He said: What! even if I bring to you something manifest?</li>
         
         <li>Said he: Bring it then, if you are of the truthful ones.</li>
         
         <li>So he cast down his rod, and lo! it was an obvious serpent,</li>
         
         <li>And he drew forth his hand, and lo! it appeared white to the onlookers.</li>
         
         <li>(Firon) said to the chiefs around him: Most surely this is a skillful magician,</li>
         
         <li>Who desires to turn you out of your land with his magic; what is it then that you
            advise?
         </li>
         
         <li>They said: Give him and his brother respite and send heralds into the cities;</li>
         
         <li>That they should bring to you every skillful magician.</li>
         
         <li>So the magicians were gathered together at the appointed time on the fixed day,</li>
         
         <li>And it was said to the people: Will you gather together?</li>
         
         <li>Haply we may follow the magicians, if they are the vanquishers.</li>
         
         <li>And when the magicians came, they said to Firon: Shall we get a reward if we are the
            vanquishers?
         </li>
         
         <li>He said: Yes, and surely you will then be of those who are made near.</li>
         
         <li>Musa said to them: Cast what you are going to cast.</li>
         
         <li>So they cast down their cords and their rods and said: By Firon's power, we shall
            most surely be victorious.
         </li>
         
         <li>Then Musa cast down his staff and lo! it swallowed up the lies they told.</li>
         
         <li>And the magicians were thrown down prostrate;</li>
         
         <li>They said: We believe in the Lord of the worlds:</li>
         
         <li>The Lord of Musa and Haroun.</li>
         
         <li>Said he: You believe in him before I give you permission; most surely he is the chief
            of you who taught you the magic, so you shall know: certainly I will cut off your
            hands and your feet on opposite sides, and certainly I will crucify you all.
         </li>
         
         <li>They said: No harm; surely to our Lord we go back;</li>
         
         <li>Surely we hope that our Lord will forgive us our wrongs because we are the first of
            the believers.
         </li>
         
         <li>And We revealed to Musa, saying: Go away with My servants travelling by night, surely
            you will be pursued.
         </li>
         
         <li>So Firon sent heralds into the cities;</li>
         
         <li>Most surely these are a small company;</li>
         
         <li>And most surely they have enraged us;</li>
         
         <li>And most surely we are a vigilant multitude.</li>
         
         <li>So We turned them out of gardens and springs,</li>
         
         <li>And treasures and goodly dwellings,</li>
         
         <li>Even so. And We gave them as a heritage to the children of Israel.</li>
         
         <li>Then they pursued them at sunrise.</li>
         
         <li>So when the two hosts saw each other, the companions of Musa cried out: Most surely
            we are being overtaken.
         </li>
         
         <li>He said: By no means; surely my Lord is with me: He will show me a way out.</li>
         
         <li>Then We revealed to Musa: Strike the sea with your staff. So it had cloven asunder,
            and each part was like a huge mound.
         </li>
         
         <li>And We brought near, there, the others.</li>
         
         <li>And We saved Musa and those with him, all of them.</li>
         
         <li>Then We drowned the others.</li>
         
         <li>Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe.</li>
         
         <li>And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.</li>
         
         <li>And recite to them the story of Ibrahim.</li>
         
         <li>When he said to his father and his people: What do you worship?</li>
         
         <li>They said: We worship idols, so we shall be their votaries.</li>
         
         <li>He said: Do they hear you when you call?</li>
         
         <li>Or do they profit you or cause you harm?</li>
         
         <li>They said: Nay, we found our fathers doing so.</li>
         
         <li>He said: Have you then considered what you have been worshipping:</li>
         
         <li>You and your ancient sires.</li>
         
         <li>Surely they are enemies to me, but not (so) the Lord of the worlds;</li>
         
         <li>Who created me, then He has shown me the way:</li>
         
         <li>And He Who gives me to eat and gives me to drink:</li>
         
         <li>And when I am sick, then He restores me to health;</li>
         
         <li>And He Who will cause me to die, then give me life;</li>
         
         <li>And Who, I hope, will forgive me my mistakes on the day of judgment.</li>
         
         <li>My Lord: Grant me wisdom, and join me with the good;</li>
         
         <li>And ordain for me a goodly mention among posterity;</li>
         
         <li>And make me of the heirs of the garden of bliss;</li>
         
         <li>And forgive my father, for surely he is of those who have gone astray;</li>
         
         <li>And disgrace me not on the day when they are raised,</li>
         
         <li>The day on which property will not avail, nor sons,</li>
         
         <li>Except him who comes to Allah with a heart free (from evil).</li>
         
         <li>And the garden shall be brought near for those who guard (against evil),</li>
         
         <li>And the hell shall be made manifest to the erring ones,</li>
         
         <li>And it shall be said to them: Where are those that you used to worship;</li>
         
         <li>Besides Allah? Can they help you or yet help themselves?</li>
         
         <li>So they shall be thrown down into it, they and the erring ones,</li>
         
         <li>And the hosts of the Shaitan, all.</li>
         
         <li>They shall say while they contend therein:</li>
         
         <li>By Allah! we were certainly in manifest error,</li>
         
         <li>When we made you equal to the Lord of the worlds;</li>
         
         <li>And none but the guilty led us astray;</li>
         
         <li>So we have no intercessors,</li>
         
         <li>Nor a true friend;</li>
         
         <li>But if we could but once return, we would be of the believers.</li>
         
         <li>Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe.</li>
         
         <li>And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.</li>
         
         <li>The people of Nuh rejected the apostles.</li>
         
         <li>When their brother Nuh said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)?</li>
         
         <li>Surely I am a faithful apostle to you;</li>
         
         <li>Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me;</li>
         
         <li>And I do not ask you any reward for it; my reward is only with the Lord of the
            worlds:
         </li>
         
         <li>So guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me.</li>
         
         <li>They said: Shall we believe in you while the meanest follow you?</li>
         
         <li>He said: And what knowledge have I of what they do?</li>
         
         <li>Their account is only with my Lord, if you could perceive</li>
         
         <li>And I am not going to drive away the believers;</li>
         
         <li>I am naught but a plain warner.</li>
         
         <li>They said: If you desist not, O Nuh, you shall most certainly be of those stoned to
            death.
         </li>
         
         <li>He said: My Lord! Surely my people give me the lie!</li>
         
         <li>Therefore judge Thou between me and them with a (just) judgment, and deliver me and
            those who are with me of the believers.
         </li>
         
         <li>So We delivered him and those with him in the laden ark.</li>
         
         <li>Then We drowned the rest afterwards</li>
         
         <li>Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe.</li>
         
         <li>And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.</li>
         
         <li>Ad gave the lie to the apostles.</li>
         
         <li>When their brother Hud said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)?</li>
         
         <li>Surely I am a faithful apostle to you;</li>
         
         <li>Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me:</li>
         
         <li>And I do not ask you any reward for it; surely my reward is only with the Lord of
            the
            worlds;
         </li>
         
         <li>Do you build on every height a monument? Vain is it that you do:</li>
         
         <li>And you make strong fortresses that perhaps you may</li>
         
         <li>And when you lay hands (on men) you lay hands (like) tyrants;</li>
         
         <li>So guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me</li>
         
         <li>And be careful of (your duty to) Him Who has given you abundance of what you
            know.
         </li>
         
         <li>He has given you abundance of cattle and children,</li>
         
         <li>And gardens and fountains;</li>
         
         <li>Surely I fear for you the chastisement of a grievous day.</li>
         
         <li>They said: It is the same to us whether you admonish or are not one of the
            admonishers;
         </li>
         
         <li>This is naught but a custom of the ancients;</li>
         
         <li>And we are not going to be punished.</li>
         
         <li>So they gave him the lie, then We destroyed them. Most surely there is a sign in
            this, but most of them do not believe.
         </li>
         
         <li>And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.</li>
         
         <li>Samood gave the lie to the apostles.</li>
         
         <li>When their brother Salih said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)?</li>
         
         <li>Surely I am a faithful apostle to you;</li>
         
         <li>Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me:</li>
         
         <li>And I do not ask you any reward for it; my reward is only with the Lord of the
            worlds:
         </li>
         
         <li>Will you be left secure in what is here;</li>
         
         <li>In gardens and fountains,</li>
         
         <li>And cornfields and palm-trees having fine spadices?</li>
         
         <li>And you hew houses out of the mountains exultingly;</li>
         
         <li>Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me;</li>
         
         <li>And do not obey the bidding of the extravagant,</li>
         
         <li>Who make mischief in the land and do not act aright.</li>
         
         <li>They said: You are only of the deluded ones;</li>
         
         <li>You are naught but a mortal like ourselves; so bring a sign if you are one of the
            truthful.
         </li>
         
         <li>He said: This is a she-camel; she shall have her portion of water, and you have your
            portion of water on an appointed time;
         </li>
         
         <li>And do not touch her with evil, lest the punishment of a grievous day should overtake
            you.
         </li>
         
         <li>But they hamstrung her, then regretted;</li>
         
         <li>So the punishment overtook them. Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of
            them do not believe.
         </li>
         
         <li>And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.</li>
         
         <li>The people of Lut gave the lie to the apostles.</li>
         
         <li>When their brother Lut said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)?</li>
         
         <li>Surely I am a faithful apostle to you;</li>
         
         <li>Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me:</li>
         
         <li>And I do not ask you any reward for it; my reward is only with the Lord of the
            worlds;
         </li>
         
         <li>What! do you come to the males from among the creatures,</li>
         
         <li>And leave what your Lord has created for you of your wives? Nay, you are a people
            exceeding limits.
         </li>
         
         <li>They said: If you desist not, O Lut! you shall surely be of those who are
            expelled.
         </li>
         
         <li>He said: Surely I am of those who utterly abhor your doing;</li>
         
         <li>My Lord! deliver me and my followers from what they do.</li>
         
         <li>So We delivered him and his followers all,</li>
         
         <li>Except an old woman, among those who remained behind.</li>
         
         <li>Then We utterly destroyed the others.</li>
         
         <li>And We rained down upon them a rain, and evil was the rain on those warned.</li>
         
         <li>Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe.</li>
         
         <li>And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.</li>
         
         <li>The dwellers of the thicket gave the lie to the apostles.</li>
         
         <li>When Shu'aib said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)?</li>
         
         <li>Surely I am a faithful apostle to you;</li>
         
         <li>Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me:</li>
         
         <li>And I do not ask you any reward for it, my reward is only with the Lord of the
            worlds;
         </li>
         
         <li>Give a full measure and be not of those who diminish;</li>
         
         <li>And weigh (things) with a right balance,</li>
         
         <li>And do not wrong men of their things, and do not act corruptly in the earth, making
            mischief.
         </li>
         
         <li>And guard against (the punishment of) Him who created you and the former nations.</li>
         
         <li>They said: You are only of those deluded;</li>
         
         <li>And you are naught but a mortal like ourselves, and we know you to be certainly of
            the liars.
         </li>
         
         <li>Therefore cause a portion of the heaven to come down upon us, if you are one of the
            truthful.
         </li>
         
         <li>He said: My Lord knows best what you do.</li>
         
         <li>But they called him a liar, so the punishment of the day of covering overtook them;
            surely it was the punishment of a grievous day.
         </li>
         
         <li>Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe.</li>
         
         <li>And most surely your Lord is Mighty, the Merciful.</li>
         
         <li>And most surely this is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds.</li>
         
         <li>The Faithful Spirit has descended with it,</li>
         
         <li>Upon your heart that you may be of the warners,</li>
         
         <li>In plain Arabic language.</li>
         
         <li>And most surely the same is in the scriptures of the ancients.</li>
         
         <li>Is it not a sign to them that the learned men of the Israelites know it?</li>
         
         <li>And if we had revealed it to any of the foreigners,</li>
         
         <li>So that he should have recited it to them, they would not have believed therein.</li>
         
         <li>Thus have We caused it to enter into the hearts of the guilty.</li>
         
         <li>They will not believe in it until they see the painful punishment.</li>
         
         <li>And it shall come to them all of a sudden, while they shall not perceive;</li>
         
         <li>Then they will say: Shall we be respited?</li>
         
         <li>What! do they still seek to hasten on Our punishment?</li>
         
         <li>Have you then considered if We let them enjoy themselves for years,</li>
         
         <li>Then there comes to them that with which they are threatened,</li>
         
         <li>That which they were made to enjoy shall not avail them?</li>
         
         <li>And We did not destroy any town but it had (its) warners,</li>
         
         <li>To remind, and We are never unjust.</li>
         
         <li>And the Shaitans have not come down with it.</li>
         
         <li>And it behooves them not, and they have not the power to do (it).</li>
         
         <li>Most surely they are far removed from the hearing of it.</li>
         
         <li>So call not upon another god with Allah, lest you be of those who are punished.</li>
         
         <li>And warn your nearest relations,</li>
         
         <li>And be kind to him who follows you of the believers.</li>
         
         <li>But if they disobey you, then say: Surely I am clear of what you do.</li>
         
         <li>And rely on the Mighty, the Merciful,</li>
         
         <li>Who sees you when you stand up.</li>
         
         <li>And your turning over and over among those who prostrate themselves before Allah.</li>
         
         <li>Surely He is the Hearing, the Knowing.</li>
         
         <li>Shall I inform you (of him) upon whom the Shaitans descend?</li>
         
         <li>They descend upon every lying, sinful one,</li>
         
         <li>They incline their ears, and most of them are liars.</li>
         
         <li>And as to the poets, those who go astray follow them.</li>
         
         <li>Do you not see that they wander about bewildered in every valley?</li>
         
         <li>And that they say that which they do not do,</li>
         
         <li>Except those who believe and do good and remember Allah much, and defend themselves
            after they are oppressed; and they who act unjustly shall know to what final place
            of turning they shall turn back.
         </li>
