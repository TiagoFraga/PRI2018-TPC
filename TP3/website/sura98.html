      <h4>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </h4>
      <ul>
         
         
         
         
         <li>Those who disbelieved from among the followers of the Book and the polytheists could
            not have separated (from the faithful) until there had come to them the clear
            evidence:
         </li>
         
         <li>An apostle from Allah, reciting pure pages,</li>
         
         <li>Wherein are all the right ordinances.</li>
         
         <li>And those who were given the Book did not become divided except after clear evidence
            had come to them.
         </li>
         
         <li>And they were not enjoined anything except that they should serve Allah, being
            sincere to Him in obedience, upright, and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, and
            that is the right religion.
         </li>
         
         <li>Surely those who disbelieve from among the followers of the Book and the polytheists
            shall be in the fire of hell, abiding therein; they are the worst of men.
         </li>
         
         <li>(As for) those who believe and do good, surely they are the -best of men.</li>
         
         <li>Their reward with their Lord is gardens of perpetuity beneath which rivers flow,
            abiding therein for ever; Allah is well pleased with them and they are well pleased
            with Him; that is for him who fears his Lord.
         </li>
         
      </ul>
