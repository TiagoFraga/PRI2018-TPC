      <h4>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </h4>
      <ul>
         
         
         
         
         <li>Qaf. I swear by the glorious Quran (that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.)</li>
         
         <li>Nay! they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves, so the
            unbelievers say: This is a wonderful thing:
         </li>
         
         <li>What! when we are dead and have become dust? That is afar (from probable) return.</li>
         
         <li>We know indeed what the earth diminishes of them, and with Us is a writing that
            preserves.
         </li>
         
         <li>Nay, they rejected the truth when it came to them, so they are (now) in a state of
            confusion.
         </li>
         
         <li>Do they not then look up to heaven above them how We have made it and adorned it and
            it has no gaps?
         </li>
         
         <li>And the earth, We have made it plain and cast in it mountains and We have made to
            grow therein of all beautiful kinds,
         </li>
         
         <li>To give sight and as a reminder to every servant who turns frequently (to Allah).</li>
         
         <li>And We send down from the cloud water abounding in good, then We cause to grow
            thereby gardens and the grain that is reaped,
         </li>
         
         <li>And the tall palm-trees having spadices closely set one above another,</li>
         
         <li>A sustenance for the servants, and We give life thereby to a dead land; thus is the
            rising.
         </li>
         
         <li>(Others) before them rejected (prophets): the people of Nuh and the dwellers of
            Ar-Rass and Samood,
         </li>
         
         <li>And Ad and Firon and Lut's brethren,</li>
         
         <li>And the dwellers of the grove and the people of Tuba; all rejected the apostles, so
            My threat came to pass.
         </li>
         
         <li>Were We then fatigued with the first creation? Yet are they in doubt with regard to
            a
            new creation.
         </li>
         
         <li>And certainly We created man, and We know what his mind suggests to him, and We are
            nearer to him than his life-vein.
         </li>
         
         <li>When the two receivers receive, sitting on the right and on the left.</li>
         
         <li>He utters not a word but there is by him a watcher at hand.</li>
         
         <li>And the stupor of death will come in truth; that is what you were trying to
            escape.
         </li>
         
         <li>And the trumpet shall be blown; that is the day of the threatening.</li>
         
         <li>And every soul shall come, with it a driver and a witness.</li>
         
         <li>Certainly you were heedless of it, but now We have removed from you your veil, so
            your sight today is sharp.
         </li>
         
         <li>And his companions shall say: This is what is ready with me.</li>
         
         <li>Do cast into hell every ungrateful, rebellious one,</li>
         
         <li>Forbidder of good, exceeder of limits, doubter,</li>
         
         <li>Who sets up another god with Allah, so do cast him into severe chastisement.</li>
         
         <li>His companion will say: Our Lord! I did not lead him into inordinacy but he himself
            was in a great error.
         </li>
         
         <li>He will say: Do not quarrel in My presence, and indeed I gave you the threatening
            beforehand:
         </li>
         
         <li>My word shall not be changed, nor am I in the least unjust to the servants.</li>
         
         <li>On the day that We will say to hell: Are you filled up? And it will say: Are there
            any more?
         </li>
         
         <li>And the garden shall be brought near to those who guard (against evil), not far
            off:
         </li>
         
         <li>This is what you were promised, (it is) for every one who turns frequently (to
            Allah), keeps (His limits);
         </li>
         
         <li>Who fears the Beneficent God in secret and comes with a penitent heart:</li>
         
         <li>Enter it in peace, that is the day of abiding.</li>
         
         <li>They have therein what they wish and with Us is more yet.</li>
         
         <li>And how many a generation did We destroy before them who were mightier in prowess
            than they, so they went about and about in the lands. Is there a place of
            refuge?
         </li>
         
         <li>Most surely there is a reminder in this for him who has a heart or he gives ear and
            is a witness.
         </li>
         
         <li>And certainly We created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six
            periods and there touched Us not any fatigue.
         </li>
         
         <li>Therefore be patient of what they say, and sing the praise of your Lord before the
            rising of the sun and before the setting.
         </li>
         
         <li>And glorify Him in the night and after the prayers.</li>
         
         <li>And listen on the day when the crier shall cry from a near place,</li>
         
         <li>The day when they shall hear the cry in truth; that is the day of coming forth.</li>
         
         <li>Surely We give life and cause to die, and to Us is the eventual coming;</li>
         
         <li>The day on which the earth shall cleave asunder under them, they will make haste;
            that is a gathering together easy to Us.
         </li>
         
         <li>We know best what they say, and you are not one to compel them; therefore remind him
            by means of the Quran who fears My threat.
         </li>
         
      </ul>
